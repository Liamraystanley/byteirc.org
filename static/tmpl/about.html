<p style="font-size: 20px;margin: 30px 0 30px;">
    ByteIRC was founded by a few programmers that were looking to branch out,
    as they didn't see many IRC networks that fit their.. needs. As of writing
    this, ByteIRC is still extremely new, however we plan to see this network
    out, in hopes to grow a very large community. If this fits you, I highly
    suggest mingling with out members, inviting various other communities,
    and as one, we will grow very large!
